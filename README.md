# QuickTransfer App

This is a payment application that allows users to securely transfer money to other users. The app features a user-friendly dashboard where users can search for other users, check their balance, and send money. It is built using **Node**,  **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Axios**, and **Vite**.

## Features

### User Dashboard
- **View Balance**: Displays the current user's balance.
- **Search Users**: Search for other users by username. The current user's own account is filtered out from the search results.
- **User List**: Displays a list of users that match the search query with the ability to send money to them.

### Send Money
- **Transfer Funds**: Send a specified amount of money to a user by selecting them from the search results.
- **Confirmation Message**: After a successful transfer, the app displays the new balance of the user.

### Authentication
- **Token-Based Authentication**: All API requests are authenticated using tokens stored in `localStorage`. Each request requires a valid token to access user data.
